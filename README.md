# CitiBike iOS Application

  This application pulls live data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/stations/json and displays it using MapKit. The map uses custom pins to mark the locations of the bike stations. Depending on the station's capacity, the pin is customized to show which have a lot of bikes and which have few bikes. When you zoom in, the pins change type and become a more detailed pin that can be clicked on to give station details in a custom subview.
